# variables_sgr-escape-sequence

This function set up variables for the sgr escape sequences to mek it possible to change color and attributes of text printed to the current terminal.

I have a blog post on how to use this function in a script here: [Script Tip: Modifying text appearance in console output](http://erikberglund.github.io/2016/Script_Tip_Modifying_text_appearance_in_console_output/)
