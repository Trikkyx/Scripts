## letsEncryptJSS

This script sets up and manages Let's Encrypt for a JSS running on Ubuntu 14.04.

**NOTE! This script only handles a single JSS configuration in the tomcat settings.**

### Configuration

Configure the following variables before using the script:

**sslEmail**

```bash
# E-mail address for the certificate CA
sslEmail="ca@example.com"
```

**sslDomain**

```bash
# Domain for the certificate
sslDomain="jss.example.com"
```

**tomcatKeystorePassword**

```bash
# Password for Tomcat keystore
tomcatKeystorePassword="passw0rd"
```

### Execution

The script will create a backup of the jss server xml before modifying it.

If nothing was modified, the backup is removed to only keep actual configuration changes as backup.
